**About**
In my Power BI learning journey, I built this project to explore end-to-end data analysis — from data cleaning and modeling to DAX calculations and dashboard design. It helped me strengthen my understanding of Power BI’s analytical capabilities, time intelligence functions, and visualization techniques while working on real-world sales data.
